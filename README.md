# 54
##### A beautiful, responsive, retina-ready website.

Crafted with care, to serve as the face of a very special event.

## Notes

 * Check in npm dependencies; this is a website.
 * `LESS` files are compiled on app init.
 * Front-end framework is Bootstrap + Designmodo's Flat UI.
 * All images must be retina ready, and leave your PSD in `/psds` so others can use it
